# 🔧 Admin Routing Fix

## Problem
When logging in through `/secure-access`, users were being redirected to the wrong admin panel. The login was redirecting to `/admin/dashboard` but the "Back to Admin Page" buttons were navigating to `/admin`, causing confusion.

## Root Cause
There are two different admin pages with different purposes:

1. **`/admin`** - Main Admin Hub (AdminPage component)
   - Shows admin tool cards (Jobs, Applicants, Leads, Users)
   - Central navigation hub
   - Clean, card-based interface

2. **`/admin/dashboard`** - Detailed Dashboard (AdminDashboard component)
   - Shows detailed stats and analytics
   - Recent job postings
   - More comprehensive dashboard view

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Login Redirect
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx`
- Changed redirect from `/admin/dashboard` to `/admin`
- Now users land on the main admin hub after login

### 2. Added Navigation Between Admin Pages
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx`
- Added "📊 View Detailed Dashboard" button
- Allows easy navigation to the detailed dashboard

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Added "← Back to Admin Hub" button
- Allows easy navigation back to the main admin page

## Admin Page Structure

```
/secure-access (Login)
    ↓
/admin (Main Admin Hub)
    ├── Jobs Management → /admin/jobs
    ├── Applicants → /admin/applicants
    ├── Leads → /admin/leads
    ├── Manage Users → /admin/user-management
    └── 📊 View Detailed Dashboard → /admin/dashboard
            ↓
        /admin/dashboard (Detailed Dashboard)
            └── ← Back to Admin Hub → /admin
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Login**: User logs in via `/secure-access`
2. **Landing**: User lands on `/admin` (main admin hub)
3. **Navigation**: User can access different admin tools or view detailed dashboard
4. **Consistency**: All "Back to Admin Page" buttons now go to the same place (`/admin`)

## Benefits

- ✅ Consistent navigation experience
- ✅ Clear separation between admin hub and detailed dashboard
- ✅ Easy navigation between both admin views
- ✅ No more confusion about which admin page to use
- ✅ Logical flow from login to main admin hub

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Go to `/secure-access`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Verify you land on `/admin` (main admin hub)
4. Click "📊 View Detailed Dashboard" to go to `/admin/dashboard`
5. Click "← Back to Admin Hub" to return to `/admin`
6. Navigate to any admin tool (e.g., Job Management)
7. Click "Back to Admin Page" - should go to `/admin`

The routing should now be consistent and intuitive!
